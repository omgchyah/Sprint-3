I started by installing Tailwind

Then I edited my .htacces to make sure it landed directly cony my web/index.php file

I modified my config/routes.php files to include an array of my routes
$routes = [
    '/' => 'home#index',
    'home/index' => 'home#index',
    'user/profile' => 'user#profile',
    // Add other routes here
];
